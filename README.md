## Objective of Portfolio
<p>The first iteration of <a href="https://www.elliottkan.com" target="_blank">elliottkan.com</a>.</p>
<p>The objective of this portfolio was to create a portfolio website whilst giving myself an opportunity with working with React and Typescript.<p>
<p>This is the MVP which I decided to deploy just to 'have something out there'. There are still some kinks to iron out - which involve adding animations, slight bug-fixes and code to refactor in the back end. There are still some other miscellaneous sections to be released so keep an eye out for that!<p>

### This app has been completed with the following:
<ul>
<li>Front-end: Typescript/Javascript, React, SCSS, HTML
<li>Hosted on: GatsbyCloud
<li>Ideation & Design: Figma
</ul>
